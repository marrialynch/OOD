- **Level 3** requires you to extend and maintain your existing codebase from Level 1 and Level 2. It's crucial to practice code design and refactoring to prepare adequately for this level.
- **Level 4** is the final level that requires you to optimize your code for performance. It's essential to practice optimizing your code for performance to perform well on this level.
